The plan for this week involves implementing the following steps for CartPole-v1 environment:

1. Random rollout data collection
2. Training MLP dynamics model on the collected data
3. Planning with the learned model using Random Shooting and CEM

We assume we have access to external rewards in each step; no intrinsic rewards are considered for now.
