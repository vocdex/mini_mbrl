MiniMBRL is a minimal implementation of model-based reinforcement learning algorithms. The goal is to implement the most basic version of the algorithms to understand the core concepts and to build on top of them.


## Status
Here is the list of algorithms that I plan to implement:
#### Dyna-style algorithms:
- [Dyna: An Integrated Architecture for Learning, Planning, and Reacting](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/122344.122377). Paper Notes: [Dyna](notes/01_Dyna.pdf)
- [World Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.10122.pdf)
- [PlaNet: Planning Network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.04551.pdf)
-  [Dream to Control: Learning Behaviors by Latent Imagination(Dreamer V1)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01603)
- [Mastering Atari with Discrete World Models(Dreamer V2)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.02193)
- [DayDreamer: World Models for Physical Robot Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.14176)
- [Planning to Explore via Self-Supervised World Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.05960)

#### MPC-based algorithms:
